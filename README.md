## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
- Using CSS custom properties (variables)
- When writing classes, structure in a logical way and use up to 3 words (is it a good standard?!)
- Mind about the margin and padding in order to fit the measures.
- To space items, avoid using two specs to obtain one spacing (margin or padding, dependingon the most suitable).
